# 42-CPP-Module

## Description
This repository contains a series of C++ modules developed as part of the 42 curriculum. Each module covers different aspects of the C++ language, from basic concepts to advanced techniques. Topics include namespaces, classes, member functions, input/output streams, initialization lists, static members, constants, memory allocation, member pointers, references, and the switch statement.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into modules, each focusing on specific aspects of C++:
- **CPP-Module-00**: Basic C++ fundamentals
- **CPP-Module-01**: Constructors and destructors
- **CPP-Module-02**: Inheritance and polymorphism
- **CPP-Module-03**: Operator overloading
- **CPP-Module-04**: Templates and generic programming
- **CPP-Module-05**: Dynamic memory allocation
- **CPP-Module-06**: Exception handling
- **CPP-Module-07**: Standard Template Library (STL)
- **CPP-Module-08**: Advanced file manipulation
- **CPP-Module-09**: Additional resources and advanced techniques

Each module contains exercises and practical examples to consolidate the learning of the concepts presented.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- C++ compiler (such as GCC or Clang)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

## How to Use
To compile and run the modules using Makefiles, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/i4b2c/42-CPP-Module.git
    cd 42-CPP-Module
    ```

2. Navigate to the desired module:
    ```sh
    cd CPP-Module-00
    ```

3. Compile the code using the Makefile:
    ```sh
    make
    ```

4. Run the program:
    ```sh
    ./program_name
    ```
    **Note**: Replace `program_name` with the name of the executable generated by the Makefile.

5. Clean up the compiled files:
    ```sh
    make clean
    ```
